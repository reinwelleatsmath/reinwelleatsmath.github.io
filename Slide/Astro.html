            <h1>Astrophysics</h1>
            <p>Astrophysics is a branch of space science that applies the laws of physics and chemistry to seek to understand the universe and our place in it. The field explores topics such as the birth, life and death of stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae and other objects in the universe.</p>

                <h5>Popularization</h5>
                <p>The roots of astrophysics can be found in the seventeenth century emergence of a unified physics, in which the same laws applied to the celestial and terrestrial realms.[11] There were scientists who were qualified in both physics and astronomy who laid the firm foundation for the current science of astrophysics.</p>

                <h5>History </h5>
                <p>Astrophysics is a science that employs the methods and principles of physics and chemistry in the study of astronomical objects and phenomena.[1][2] As one of the founders of the discipline, James Keeler, said, Astrophysics "seeks to ascertain the nature of the heavenly bodies, rather than their positions or motions in spaceâ€“what they are, rather than where they are.</p>

                <h5>Observational astrophysics</h5>
                <p>Observational astronomy is a division of the astronomical science that is concerned with recording and interpreting data, in contrast with theoretical astrophysics, which is mainly concerned with finding out the measurable implications of physical models. It is the practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus.
                    The majority of astrophysical observations are made using the electromagnetic spectrum.</p>

                <h5>Theoretical astrophysics</h5>
                <p>Theoretical astrophysicists use a wide variety of tools which include analytical models (for example, polytropes to approximate the behaviors of a star) and computational numerical simulations. Each has some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better for giving insight into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that would otherwise not be seen.</p>
